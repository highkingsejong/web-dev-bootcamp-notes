        <p>
            The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is a 2011 <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_role-playing_game">action role-playing game</a> developed by
            Bethesda Game Studios and
            published by Bethesda Softworks. It is the fifth main installment in The Elder Scrolls series, following The
            Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion (2006), and was released worldwide for Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 on
            November 11, 2011. Skyrim was developed using the Creation Engine, which was rebuilt specifically for the
            game. The team opted for a unique and more diverse open world than Oblivion's Imperial Province of Cyrodiil,
            which game director and executive producer Todd Howard considered less interesting by comparison.

            The game is set 200 years after the events of Oblivion and takes place in Skyrim, the northernmost province
            of Tamriel, a continent on the planet Nirn. Its main story focuses on the player character, the Dragonborn,
            on their quest to defeat Alduin the World-Eater, a dragon prophesied to destroy the world. Throughout the
            game, the player completes quests and develops the character by improving skills. The game continues the
            open world tradition of its predecessors by allowing the player to travel to discovered locations in the
            game world at any time, and to ignore or postpone the main storyline indefinitely.

            Upon release, the game received critical acclaim, with praise for its character advancement, world design,
            visuals, and the ability to dual-wield in combat. Criticism targeted the melee combat, dragon battles, and
            numerous technical issues present at launch. The game shipped over seven million units within the first week
            of its release and had sold over 20 million units by June 2013. It is considered one of the greatest video
            games ever made.

            Three downloadable content (DLC) add-ons were released: Dawnguard, Hearthfire and Dragonborn, which were
            bundled along with the base game into the "Legendary Edition" released in June 2013. A remastered version
            subtitled Special Edition, containing all three DLC add-ons along with a graphical upgrade, was released in
            October 2016; a port for the Nintendo Switch was released in November 2017 alongside a separate virtual
            reality-only version titled Skyrim VR. In addition, the remastered version was bundled with additional
            Creation Club content and released as the "Anniversary Edition" in 2021–22. A sequel, The Elder Scrolls VI,
            is currently in development.

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is a fantasy action role-playing game, playable from either a first or
            third-person perspective. The player may freely roam over the land of Skyrim, an open world environment
            based on Scandinavia consisting of wilderness expanses, dungeons, caves, cities, towns, fortresses, and
            villages.[1] Players may navigate the game world more quickly by riding horses, paying for a ride from a
            city's stable, or utilizing a fast-travel system that allows them to move their character immediately to a
            previously discovered location.[2]

            At the beginning of the game, players select their character's gender and race, with 10 choices for the
            latter, including races of humans and fantasy races such as elves and orcs. The player chooses the
            character's appearance; this is not necessarily permanent, however, as an in-game mechanic allows for
            changing the appearance later.[3] Characters have three primary attributes: health is how much damage the
            character can take before dying, magicka is depleted to cast spells, and stamina allows the character to
            perform heavy "power attacks" or sprint. A status bar for each attribute appears onscreen when the attribute
            falls below its maximum value. Attributes regenerate over time and can be refilled faster by drinking
            potions, casting regenerative spells, or through various enchantments.[4] Characters gain experience
            indirectly, via leveling up skills. The 18 skills are divided evenly among the three schools of combat,
            magic, and stealth. Each skill has its own experience bar, which increases when the character performs an
            action in-game related to the skill. For example, crafting a dagger increases the Smithing skill, and
            dealing damage with a bow increases the Archery skill. When a skill's experience bar fills, the skill levels
            up and the bar is reset. After enough skills level up, the character levels up, enabling the player to
            increase the maximum value of one of the three attributes and providing a perk point. Perk points can be
            spent immediately on a skill-specific perk or stored for later use.[5][6]

            Setting
        </h3>
        <p>
            Skyrim is set 200 years after the events of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, although it is not a direct
            sequel.[18] Skyrim is a cold and mountainous region in the north of the continent of Tamriel. It has
            traditionally been divided into nine administrative sections, called "holds", each governed by a jarl from a
            larger town. Of these settlements, Solitude, Windhelm, Markarth, Riften, and Whiterun are larger and more
            powerful. The landscape is littered with forts, camps, and ruins, some of which were built by the
            now-extinct race of the Dwemer, or Dwarves. The Nords, one of the human races, view Skyrim as their
            homeland, though members of other races populate Skyrim as well.

            Skyrim is a province of the much larger Empire, which comprises most of Tamriel. The Empire has recently
            fought a war with the elvish Aldmeri Dominion, who believe that they are racially superior to humans. While
            the conflict, known as the Great War, ended in a military stalemate after a hard-fought battle at the
            imperial capital, the greatly weakened Empire was forced to sign a humiliating peace treaty called the
            White-Gold Concordat.

            While most of Tamriel worship a religious pantheon of eight deities, the Nords of Skyrim are accustomed to
            worshiping a ninth god, Talos, the deified Nord general who founded the Empire. The Dominion, led by the
            intolerant Thalmor sect, rejects this notion and its implication that a man became greater than any elf.
            They instituted a clause in the Concordat forbidding Talos worship in the Empire. Motivated in part by this
            condition, Ulfric Stormcloak, the jarl of Windhelm, leads a rebellion against imperial rule, with the holds
            divided between the two sides.

            In the ancient past, dragons ruled over vast swaths of Tamriel. Their hegemony was overthrown when three
            human warriors threw the dragon ruler, Alduin, forward in time using an Elder Scroll, a powerful and
            mysterious artifact. When Skyrim begins, the survival of the last dragon, the sage Paarthurnax, is a secret
            kept by an order of monks called the Greybeards. Within their monastery atop the Throat of the World,
            Skyrim's highest mountain, the Greybeards dedicate their lives to the Way of the Voice, a discipline for
            powerful draconic spells called "shouts". Generational warriors are "Dragonborn", able to learn shouts
            intuitively by absorbing the souls of dead dragons. Ancient prophecy maintains that Alduin will return to
            consume the world, and a "Last Dragonborn" will defeat him.

        <h3>Characters</h3>
        <p>
            The player character is Dragonborn and is typically referred to as such. The Dragonborn can be male or
            female, from one of ten races. Each of the ten races has, in addition to a bonus for certain skills, a power
            specific to their race – for example, Nords start with a bonus to several martial skills, and the ability to
            intimidate enemies for a short period. The player can recruit one NPC at a time as a follower, who can
            travel and fight alongside the Dragonborn; there are forty-five available followers in the base game, with
            thirteen more added in the downloadable expansions.
